Entry 1: Research, Planning 
Date: [Start Date, 2025-12-06] Time Spent: 4 hours

Work Done (Planning & Research): Planning and researching kicked off this project. I began by watching several videos on similar split keyboard designs to understand different approaches, noting what worked and what I could adapt or improve in my own design and functionality.

Planning Support: I sketched out my ideas on paper. My Mom's degree in architecture and master's expertise really helped me figure out the optimal layout, size, and which components would be necessary for the board. (Thanks so much, Mom, if you read this!)

Entry 2: Initial PCB Setup: 48 hours
Date: [2025-12-07]
Learning & Execution (PCB): I went digital by learning to use PCB software (KiCad) from scratch. This involved a lot of trial and error with the tools, figuring out component placement and routing the connections. I often asked experienced people for advice when I got stuck.

Milestone: The final key layout was decided, and I cross-checked it against my sketches and reference designs.

Entry 3: Staring the BOM: 6 hours
Date: [2025-12-09]
Next Steps: The next step is to finalize the BOM and get the board ordered.

Entry 4: Sourcing, Costing, and Minor Redesigns
Date:(e.g., 2025-12-10) Time Spent: 5.0 hours

Work Done (Sourcing): I was able to find all of the necessary parts over the course of these 5 hours. It was a lot of fun, even though I had to redo a couple of things in the PCB layout to accommodate component availability.

Failure/Rabbit Hole: I had to adjust a section of the routing because a key component I initially planned to use was out of stock, requiring me to switch to a different component footprint.

Costing: I imported my PCB design to a manufacturer (like JLCPCB) and got an estimate. (Thanks, Dad, for the help with this!)

Thoughts: I had so much fun! Even though I had to redo a couple of things, seeing the final PCB design ready for fabrication was very rewarding.
