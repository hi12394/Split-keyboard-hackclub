The Minimalistic Board (TMB)
Project Overview
The Minimalistic Board (TMB) is a highly customized, low-profile split keyboard designed for maximum portability and comfort. It goes beyond typical split keyboard designs by integrating several unique features to enhance user productivity and experience.

Why I Made This Project
My inspiration for creating a keyboard like TMB came after watching a video by Christian Selig on building a custom keyboard (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UXsD7nSfDY). I was captivated by his goal of achieving a comfortable, smaller form factor for daily use. Ultimately, I made this product so I could type both comfortably and practically.

This idea sparked a passion in me. Coincidentally, I received an email about designing a custom split keyboard, and I dove right into learning KiCad to create a basic layout. The next day, I started sourcing parts and refining the initial concept, which eventually led to the current design—The Minimalistic Board.

Key Features & Original Touches
TMB is designed with several features to be a unique and highly functional daily driver:

Ultra-Slim Profile: Designed to be easily carried in a laptop bag.

Aesthetic Design: A clean, modern look that stands out.

Thumb Scroll Wheels (Original Feature): Integrated scroll wheels positioned near the thumbs for quick navigation (scrolling, volume control, layer switching, etc.).

Integrated OLED Screens: Small screens on each half for displaying status (layer, caps lock, WPM, etc.).

Hotswappable Keycaps & Switches: Allows for easy customization and maintenance without soldering.
